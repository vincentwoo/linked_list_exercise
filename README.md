Linked List Exercise
====================

The idea here is to implement a class that has roughly the same interface as [Ruby's Array Class](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Array.html), except that we implement it using an internal linked list structure.

The spec file `linked_list_spec.rb` should serve to guarantee that the LinkedList class behaves just like Array does.

Also, I've setup Travis to make sure that all the commits to this repo pass. The current status is:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vincentwoo/linked_list_exercise.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vincentwoo/linked_list_exercise)

Pushing code to master will automatically rerun the test suite.
