Linked List Exercise
====================

The idea here is to implement a class that has roughly the same interface as [Ruby's Array Class](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Array.html), except that we implement it using an internal linked list structure.

The spec file `linked_list_spec.rb` should serve to guarantee that the LinkedList class behaves just like Array does.
